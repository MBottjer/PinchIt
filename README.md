##Pinch
###A 'Snapchat meets Groupon' Makers Academy Final Project

####Concept
*Follow the brands you love.*<br>
*Get exclusive offers.*

Pinch is the new way for businesses to connect with fans of their brand.

Businesses post special deals to their followers, each with a 30-120s time limit. This time limit indicates how long a user has to decide whether they're going to purchase the offer or not. If the time runs out and a purchase hasn't yet been made, the deal is gone forever!

*Customer features* <br>

* Account creation, with profile avatar
* Set business category preferences
* Follow/unfollow businesses from a list of participating companies
